## User Stories

Note that there is a renewed effort to gather short user stories in a [separate repository](https://github.com/solid/user-stories).


To illustrate how Solid would work it helps to look at this in terms of the [UserStories published by the Social Web WG](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/User_stories).

For each user story we will  

* recapitulate the story  
* give one or more ways of doing this with  LDP
* list protocol or vocabulary features that need to be developed to make this functional 
* point to (known) implementations

For the initial write up of the stories we will assume that the clients prefer Turtle formats ( because that is what bblfish himself is most comforable writing ).
